      'Beauty content on Facebook averages a 0.07% engagement rate, falling below the platform\u2019s overall mean. Much of the beauty audience has migrated to Instagram and TikTok, but Facebook\u2019s older demographic still engages with skincare routines, anti-aging tips, and wellness-focused beauty content.',
    howItWorks:
      'A 0.07% engagement rate means that for every 10,000 followers on a beauty Facebook Page, roughly 7 people interact with a typical post through reactions, comments, or shares. This is slightly below Facebook\u2019s cross-industry average of around 0.065%, reflecting a broader trend: beauty audiences have largely moved to Instagram Reels and TikTok, where visual-first discovery is native to the platform.\n\nFacebook\u2019s algorithm heavily favors paid distribution over organic reach. Pages typically see only 2\u20136% of their followers in feed without boosting. This pay-to-play model hits beauty creators especially hard because the niche relies on frequent visual posts that need consistent visibility to maintain audience interest.\n\nThe real opportunity for beauty creators on Facebook lies in Groups. Skincare routine groups, product review communities, and anti-aging discussion forums regularly see 3\u20135x the engagement rates of Pages. Members actively seek advice, share before-and-after photos, and debate product ingredients\u2014behaviors that generate sustained comment threads rather than passive scrolling.\n\nVideo content remains the strongest format for beauty Pages. Tutorial-style videos, particularly those addressing concerns relevant to the 35+ demographic like hyperpigmentation treatments, mature skin routines, and clean beauty ingredient breakdowns, outperform static image posts by a wide margin. Facebook Reels offer additional reach since the platform is actively promoting short-form video to compete with TikTok.\n\nTo improve your beauty Page\u2019s engagement, focus on building a companion Group where you can cultivate discussion. Post video content natively rather than linking to YouTube. Run Facebook Live sessions for real-time product demos\u2014live video receives 6x more interactions than regular video on the platform. Tailor your messaging toward the wellness and self-care angles that resonate with Facebook\u2019s core user base.',

        question: 'Why is beauty engagement on Facebook so much lower than on Instagram?',
        answer:
          'Beauty content thrives on visual discovery, which Instagram and TikTok are specifically designed for. Facebook\u2019s feed algorithm prioritizes content from friends and family over Page posts, and most beauty consumers under 35 have shifted their attention to other platforms. The result is that beauty Pages struggle to reach their followers organically, pulling down engagement rates compared to Instagram\u2019s algorithm that actively surfaces beauty content through Explore and Reels.',

          'Facebook remains valuable for reaching consumers over 35 who have significant purchasing power for skincare, wellness, and premium beauty products. The platform\u2019s advertising tools also offer unmatched targeting precision for paid campaigns.

      'Fashion is one of the lowest-performing niches on Facebook, averaging just 0.05% engagement. The platform\u2019s mismatch with visual-first fashion content and its older user demographic create significant headwinds, though thriving communities around plus-size fashion, vintage finds, and Marketplace resale prove that pockets of strong engagement still exist.',
    howItWorks:
      'At 0.05%, fashion sits at the bottom of Facebook\u2019s engagement rankings. For a Page with 50,000 followers, that translates to about 25 interactions per post on average. This severe underperformance stems from a fundamental platform mismatch: fashion content relies on aesthetic presentation, trend discovery, and aspirational imagery\u2014all strengths of Instagram and Pinterest rather than Facebook.\n\nFacebook\u2019s organic reach suppression compounds the problem. The algorithm was redesigned in 2018 to prioritize \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d between people, which systematically disadvantages brand and creator Pages. Fashion Pages, which typically post outfit photos and product showcases, generate passive likes rather than the comment-driven discussions the algorithm rewards.\n\nDespite these challenges, specific fashion sub-niches have carved out engaged communities through Facebook Groups. Plus-size fashion groups with hundreds of thousands of members see vibrant daily activity. Vintage and thrift shopping communities share finds and discuss eras. Sustainable fashion forums debate brands and materials. These Groups succeed because they foster the discussion-based engagement that Facebook\u2019s algorithm promotes.\n\nFacebook Marketplace also provides a unique advantage for fashion resale. Creators who combine their fashion Page with Marketplace listings for curated vintage or secondhand items can drive engagement through a commerce-content loop that doesn\u2019t exist on other platforms.\n\nTo make fashion content work on Facebook, lean into community-driven formats. Post outfit polls and \u201cstyle this item\u201d challenges that encourage comments. Use Facebook Reels to reach beyond your follower base. Create or join niche Groups aligned with your fashion sub-category. Most importantly, recognize that Facebook\u2019s 35+ audience responds to practical styling advice, wardrobe capsule concepts, and confidence-focused messaging far more than trend chasing.',

The platform\u2019s core audience skews 35+, a demographic less likely to engage with fast-fashion trend content.

        question: 'How can fashion creators use Facebook Marketplace?',

Capsule wardrobe tutorials, professional outfit ideas, age-inclusive styling guides, and confidence-focused messaging resonate with the 35+ demographic. Content that solves real problems\u2014like dressing for body changes, building versatile travel wardrobes, or finding quality basics\u2014drives more saves and shares than aspirational lookbook posts.',

      {
        question: 'Should fashion brands pay to boost posts on Facebook?',

          'Given the extremely low organic reach for fashion Pages, allocating a portion of your budget to boosted posts or targeted ads is practically necessary to maintain visibility. Even a small daily budget of $5\u201310 on your best-performing content can meaningfully expand reach.

Facebook\u2019s older, financially active user base makes it one of the few platforms where retirement planning, mortgage advice, and investment discussions genuinely resonate.',
    howItWorks:
      'An 0.08% engagement rate positions finance above the typical Facebook Page average, and there\u2019s a straightforward reason: Facebook\u2019s core demographic is deeply interested in money. Users aged 35\u201365 are actively managing mortgages, retirement accounts, college savings plans, and investment portfolios. When finance creators speak to these real-world concerns, the content earns genuine engagement rather than passive scrolling.\n\nFacebook\u2019s algorithm still limits organic Page reach to 2\u20136% of followers, which constrains even high-performing finance content. However, the engagement that does occur tends to be high-quality\u2014longer comments, in-depth questions, and content saves\u2014because financial topics provoke thoughtful responses rather than quick emoji reactions.\n\nPersonal finance Groups represent the standout opportunity on this platform. Communities dedicated to budgeting methods, debt payoff journeys, FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) strategies, and real estate investing have some of the most active discussions on all of Facebook. Members share spreadsheets, celebrate milestones, ask detailed questions, and hold each other accountable. Some finance Groups maintain engagement rates above 1%\u2014more than 12x the Page average.\n\nFacebook Live sessions work particularly well for finance creators. Q&A formats where followers submit tax questions, market reactions during earnings season, or walk-throughs of budgeting tools generate real-time interaction that the algorithm heavily promotes. Live content also builds trust, which is critical in a niche where credibility directly affects audience retention.\n\nFor improving engagement, focus on creating discussion-provoking content: polls about financial goals, \u201cwhat would you do\u201d scenarios, and myth-busting posts that challenge conventional financial wisdom.

    howItWorks:
      'Fitness pages on Facebook earn a 0.10% engagement rate\u2014roughly 50% higher than the platform average. This outperformance is rooted in community dynamics: fitness is inherently social, and Facebook\u2019s Group infrastructure provides the accountability structures that keep people exercising. When someone shares a workout completion post in a Group, the congratulatory comments and reactions create a positive feedback loop that sustains daily engagement.\n\nFacebook\u2019s organic reach limitations still apply. A fitness Page with 100,000 followers might reach 3,000\u20136,000 people per post organically. But fitness content benefits from two algorithm-friendly behaviors: shares (people tagging workout partners) and saves (bookmarking routines for later). Both signal high-value content to Facebook\u2019s ranking system.\n\nFacebook Live has become a cornerstone format for fitness creators. Real-time workout sessions allow followers to exercise together, ask form questions, and receive encouragement during the broadcast. The platform notifies followers when a Live starts, circumventing the organic reach problem. Many fitness creators built substantial followings during 2020\u20132021 through Live workouts, and the format remains viable because Facebook\u2019s 35+ audience prefers longer-form guided content over TikTok-style clips.\n\nGroup challenges drive some of the highest engagement in the fitness niche. 30-day walking challenges, step-count competitions, and meal-prep accountability threads generate daily posts from participants. Each check-in receives reactions and encouragement from other members, creating consistent engagement throughout the challenge period.\n\nTo elevate your fitness Page\u2019s performance, emphasize wellness and longevity messaging over bodybuilding aesthetics. Facebook\u2019s audience responds to content about managing back pain, staying active after 40, joint-friendly exercises, and stress reduction through movement.

The overhead-shot cooking video pioneered by Tasty in 2015 was specifically optimized for Facebook\u2019s autoplay feed, and the format continues to generate millions of shares. When someone tags a family member in a recipe post or shares it to their timeline, the content reaches an entirely new audience without paid promotion.

A product review post linking to a detailed blog article will reach a fraction of the audience compared to a native text post or video, yet link sharing is central to how tech communities operate.\n\nWhere tech content does find engagement is in device-specific and software-specific Facebook Groups. Communities built around particular products\u2014iPhone troubleshooting, Samsung Galaxy tips, specific printer models, WordPress development, or Excel mastery\u2014attract users who have concrete problems to solve. These Groups generate genuine engagement because members ask real questions and receive actionable answers. A Facebook Group for a popular smart home platform might see dozens of daily troubleshooting threads.\n\nHow-to content targeted at the 35+ demographic represents an underserved opportunity. Simple tutorials on topics like setting up a VPN, migrating photos to cloud storage, understanding smartphone settings, or choosing a streaming device generate engagement from an audience that won\u2019t find (or seek) this content on Reddit or YouTube.\n\nFor improving tech engagement on Facebook, abandon the news-commentary approach and focus on problem-solving. Create native video tutorials rather than sharing links. Build or moderate a Group around a specific product category. Use Facebook Reels for quick tech tips\u2014a 30-second screen recording showing a hidden phone feature can outperform a lengthy written review. Acknowledge that your Facebook audience needs different content than your YouTube or X audience.',

        question: 'Why is tech engagement so low on Facebook compared to other platforms?',
        answer:
          'Tech enthusiasts predominantly use YouTube for reviews, Reddit for discussions, and X for breaking news. Facebook\u2019s 35+ core audience consumes technology but rarely engages in tech discussions on the platform. Additionally, tech content often relies on outbound links to reviews and articles, and Facebook\u2019s algorithm heavily penalizes posts containing external URLs, reducing their reach by 50\u201380% compared to native content.',

Topics like organizing digital photos, securing online accounts, setting up smart home devices, choosing between streaming services, or understanding phone plan options resonate strongly. This \u201ctech for real life\u201d approach fills a gap that YouTube tech channels often ignore because they target enthusiasts rather than mainstream consumers.',

        question: 'Do Facebook Reels work for tech content?',
        answer:
          'Short-form tech tips in Reels format can dramatically outperform standard Page posts. A 15\u201330 second screen recording showing a hidden phone feature, a keyboard shortcut, or a useful app generates quick engagement and benefits from Facebook\u2019s algorithmic push for Reels content. This format sidesteps the link-penalty problem since the entire tip is contained within the video itself.',

        question: 'Is it worth maintaining a tech Page on Facebook in 2026?',
        answer:
          'A standalone tech Page posting news links will struggle. However, a tech presence on Facebook serves two strategic purposes: reaching an older demographic that doesn\u2019t engage on tech-focused platforms, and tapping into Group communities where engaged users actively seek help. Consider Facebook a support and community channel rather than a primary content distribution platform, and invest most of your energy into a well-moderated Group rather than Page posts.',

      'Travel content on Facebook earns a 0.07% engagement rate, sitting right at the platform average. While Instagram and TikTok dominate travel inspiration, Facebook\u2019s strength lies in trip planning discussions, destination review Groups, and Facebook Events for travel meetups that serve its older, planning-oriented audience.',
    howItWorks:
      'Travel pages see a 0.07% engagement rate on Facebook, aligning with the overall platform mean. This moderate performance tells an interesting story: while younger travelers share aspirational content on Instagram and TikTok, Facebook\u2019s 35+ audience uses the platform for the practical side of travel\u2014researching destinations, comparing hotels, reading reviews from real people, and coordinating group trips.\n\nFacebook\u2019s suppressed organic reach hits travel Pages like every other niche. Only a fraction of followers see each post without paid promotion. However, travel content benefits from a seasonal sharing pattern: vacation photo albums still get posted to Facebook in bulk, and destination recommendations in comment threads often go viral within extended social networks.\n\nTravel Groups represent the strongest engagement opportunity. Destination-specific communities (visiting Japan, road tripping through Portugal, Disney World planning) attract members who are actively planning trips and hungry for detailed recommendations. Cruise groups, national park communities, and budget travel forums see daily activity from members sharing itineraries, asking for restaurant suggestions, and posting trip reports. This advice-seeking behavior generates the comment-heavy engagement that Facebook\u2019s algorithm rewards.\n\nFacebook Events adds a unique dimension for travel creators. Organizing local meetups, group excursions, photography walks, or travel-themed gatherings gives followers a reason to engage beyond digital content. Event pages generate RSVPs, comments, and shares that amplify reach. Travel bloggers who host annual group trips often coordinate entirely through Facebook Events and Groups.\n\nTo strengthen travel engagement on Facebook, shift from aspirational photography toward actionable planning content. Detailed packing lists, airport transit guides, budget breakdowns for specific destinations, and honest hotel reviews generate saves and shares. Use long-form posts with personal storytelling\u2014Facebook\u2019s audience reads longer content than Instagram\u2019s. Create a destination-themed Group where you can answer questions daily, and leverage Facebook Events for any in-person travel activities you organize.',

    howItWorks:
      'Entertainment\u2019s 0.08% engagement rate on Facebook sits above the platform average, and the reason connects to Facebook\u2019s social DNA. Unlike platforms optimized for creator-to-audience broadcasting, Facebook was built for peer-to-peer sharing. Entertainment content\u2014funny videos, movie discussions, TV show reactions, and pop culture debates\u2014is what people naturally share with their personal networks. Every tag, share, and comment thread amplifies entertainment content in ways that the algorithm rewards.\n\nNostalgia content is entertainment\u2019s secret weapon on Facebook. Posts about beloved TV shows from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, throwback music compilations, and \u201cremember when\u201d style content resonate powerfully with the 35\u201360 demographic that forms Facebook\u2019s backbone. A single \u201cname a movie everyone has seen\u201d post can accumulate thousands of comments because it invites low-barrier participation from a broad audience.\n\nFacebook Watch, though less prominent than YouTube or TikTok, provides an additional distribution channel for entertainment video. Episodic content, short comedy sketches, and reaction videos posted through Watch benefit from Facebook\u2019s recommendation system and can reach users who don\u2019t follow your Page. The in-stream ad monetization on Watch also offers a revenue stream that complements other platforms.\n\nFamily-friendly entertainment content outperforms edgier material on Facebook because the platform\u2019s sharing behavior is inherently social\u2014people share to timelines that parents, coworkers, and extended family see. Content that everyone in a family can enjoy gets shared more freely than niche or provocative content.\n\nTo strengthen entertainment engagement on Facebook, prioritize shareability above all else. Ask questions that invite participation (\u201cwhat\u2019s a movie that lives in your head rent-free?\u201d), post video content natively rather than linking to YouTube, and lean into the nostalgia angle that Facebook\u2019s demographic responds to.
