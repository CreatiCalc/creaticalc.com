      'Beauty content on Facebook reaches a different demographic than Instagram or TikTok — a predominantly 30–55 audience with higher disposable income and loyalty to established brands. Beauty creators earn $6–$16 per 1,000 followers, with video tutorials and group-based content performing strongest. Calculate your rate below.',
    howItWorks:
      "Beauty sponsorships on Facebook target a distinctly different audience than Instagram or TikTok. Facebook's beauty audience skews older (30–55), with higher disposable income and stronger brand loyalty. This makes Facebook beauty content valuable for established skincare brands, anti-aging products, professional beauty tools, and luxury cosmetics — products that appeal to an audience with purchasing power rather than trend-following teens. Video tutorials are the dominant sponsored format, earning $6–$16 per 1,000 followers, with native Facebook video getting significantly more organic reach than linked content. Facebook Groups add a unique sponsorship dimension — beauty creators who run active communities (skincare advice groups, makeup tips groups) can charge premium rates because the brand gets exposure to a highly engaged, trusting audience. Group-based sponsorships typically earn 1.5x standard rates. Facebook Reels are growing but remain secondary to standard video posts for beauty content on the platform. One important factor: Facebook beauty audiences are more responsive to ingredient-focused content and clinical claims (dermatologist-tested, clinical trials) than the trend-driven content that dominates TikTok. Creators who can explain why a product works, not just show it, perform best. Brands selling anti-aging skincare, professional-grade tools (LED masks, microcurrent devices), and salon-quality haircare are the most active Facebook beauty sponsors.",

        question: 'How much do beauty creators charge for Facebook sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Beauty Facebook sponsorship rates range from $6–$16 per 1,000 followers for a standard video post. A beauty creator with 80K followers would charge $480–$1,280 per sponsored video. Group-based sponsorships — where the creator promotes a product within their beauty community group — earn 1.5x standard rates because of higher trust and engagement. While per-follower rates are lower than Instagram, Facebook beauty audiences have higher purchasing power, which means conversion rates can be comparable. Many brands offer affiliate commissions (5–15%) on top of the flat fee.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why is the Facebook beauty audience different from Instagram?',
        answer:
          "Facebook's beauty audience skews significantly older (30–55 vs. 18–35 on Instagram) with higher disposable income and stronger brand loyalty. This means different products perform better: anti-aging skincare, professional beauty tools, luxury cosmetics, and clinical skincare brands thrive on Facebook, while trendy makeup and fast beauty brands perform better on Instagram and TikTok. Facebook beauty audiences also respond better to educational, ingredient-focused content than to trend-driven or aesthetic content. For brands selling premium products to women 30+, Facebook beauty creators often deliver better ROI per dollar than Instagram despite the lower raw rates.",

      {
        question: 'How do Facebook Groups affect beauty sponsorship pricing?',
        answer:
          'Facebook Groups are a unique monetization advantage for beauty creators. If you run an active beauty community group (skincare advice, makeup tips, product reviews), you can charge 1.5x standard rates for group-based sponsorships. Brands pay the premium because group members are more engaged and trusting than general page followers — they actively seek advice and recommendations, making them more likely to purchase. A group-based deal might include a pinned product recommendation post, a live Q&A featuring the product, or a community challenge using the brand. Groups with 10K+ active members can charge $500–$2,000 per campaign even without a large page following.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What beauty products sell best through Facebook sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Products targeting women 30+ perform best on Facebook: anti-aging skincare (retinol serums, eye creams, sunscreens), professional-grade beauty tools (LED masks, microcurrent devices, derma rollers), salon-quality haircare, and luxury cosmetics. Clinical and dermatologist-backed products also perform well because Facebook audiences respond to evidence-based content and ingredient explanations. Mass-market and trendy makeup products generally perform better on Instagram and TikTok where the audience is younger. Facebook is also strong for subscription beauty boxes and refillable/sustainable beauty brands that appeal to an environmentally conscious, higher-income demographic.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Should beauty creators use Facebook Reels for sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Facebook Reels are worth experimenting with but should not be your primary sponsored format yet. Standard video posts still get more reliable reach and engagement for beauty content on Facebook, particularly tutorial-format videos (3–10 minutes) that allow for detailed product demonstrations. Reels can work as supplementary content — a quick "one-minute routine" that links to a longer video or product page. If a brand specifically requests Reels content, price it at standard rates (not at Instagram Reels premium rates), since Facebook Reels distribution is less developed. Focus your primary sponsored content on native video posts and Group-based promotions.',

    howItWorks:
      "Fashion on Facebook serves demographics that are underserved on other platforms — women over 35, plus-size fashion, modest fashion, workwear, and budget-friendly styling. This makes Facebook fashion creators valuable to brands targeting these specific audiences, even though overall per-follower rates ($5–$15 per 1K) are lower than Instagram. The primary sponsors are mid-range and accessible fashion brands (Amazon fashion, Chico's, Talbots, Lane Bryant), subscription styling services (Stitch Fix, Dia & Co), and e-commerce fashion platforms. Fast fashion brands rarely sponsor on Facebook because the audience does not align with their demographic. Video lookbook content performs best — a 3–5 minute styling video showing multiple outfits earns higher engagement than static image posts. Facebook Groups are a significant monetization channel for fashion creators, particularly communities focused on specific demographics (plus-size style, workwear tips, over-40 fashion). Group-based sponsorships earn 1.5x standard rates. Facebook Marketplace has also created an organic fashion content ecosystem — styling second-hand finds and Facebook Marketplace purchases attracts both individual viewer engagement and interest from resale platforms (ThredUp, Poshmark). Seasonal demand peaks during back-to-school (August), holiday party dressing (November), and spring wardrobe transitions (March).",

These demographics have significant purchasing power but are underserved by the trend-driven, youth-focused fashion content on other platforms. Brands like Chico's, Talbots, Lane Bryant, and Stitch Fix actively seek Facebook fashion creators because it is one of the few platforms where their target customer is engaged.

If you run a fashion community group (plus-size style tips, workwear advice, over-40 fashion inspiration), brands will pay 1.5x standard rates for group-based promotions because the audience is highly engaged and trusts community recommendations. Group sponsorship formats include pinned product recommendations, live styling sessions featuring the brand, community challenges ("style this piece 3 ways"), and exclusive group discount codes.

Stitch Fix, Dia & Co, Wantable, and similar services target Facebook because the platform's demographic aligns with their customer base — busy women 30+ who want styling help without shopping in stores. Deals typically include a flat sponsorship fee ($5–$15 per 1K followers) plus a per-signup bonus ($10–$25 per new subscription through a tracked link). Unboxing and try-on videos showing the subscription service in action are the most effective sponsored format. These partnerships often recur monthly or quarterly once you demonstrate conversion ability.",

Facebook fashion rates during peak periods rise 15–25% above baseline.

      'Tech sponsorships on Facebook occupy a distinct niche — the platform\'s audience prefers practical, solution-oriented content over the enthusiast-grade reviews and unboxings that dominate YouTube. How-to guides, product comparisons, software tutorials, and "best tools for X" content perform well because Facebook\'s older, more professional audience is looking for tools to solve specific problems rather than keeping up with the latest gadgets. Rates run $6–$16 per 1,000 followers, with B2B and productivity tools earning toward the top of the range because they target professional decision-makers. The primary sponsors include productivity and SaaS tools (Notion, Monday.com, Canva), cybersecurity companies, cloud storage services, consumer electronics brands, and local tech service providers. Facebook Groups dedicated to specific professions (freelancers, small business owners, remote workers) are powerful sponsorship channels because members actively seek tool recommendations. Group-based tech sponsorships earn 1.5x standard rates. One unique advantage of Facebook tech content: the platform reaches small business owners and non-technical professionals who make purchasing decisions but do not follow tech YouTube channels. This makes Facebook the preferred platform for sponsors selling to small businesses, solopreneurs, and non-technical professionals who need technology solutions.',

        question: 'How much do tech creators charge for Facebook sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Tech Facebook sponsorship rates range from $6–$16 per 1,000 followers. A tech creator with 50K followers would charge $300–$800 per sponsored post. B2B software and productivity tool sponsorships earn at the higher end because they target professional decision-makers. Consumer electronics reviews sit at standard rates. Group-based sponsorships in professional communities (freelancer groups, small business groups) earn 1.5x. Many SaaS sponsorships include per-signup bonuses ($5–$20 per free trial or account creation), which can meaningfully increase total campaign earnings.',

        question: 'What types of tech content work best for Facebook sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'How-to guides and problem-solving content perform best for tech sponsorships on Facebook because the audience is looking for practical solutions. "Best tools for small business owners," "how to automate your invoicing," and "5 apps every freelancer needs" formats attract both viewer engagement and sponsor interest. Product comparison videos work well when they focus on practical use cases rather than specs. Software tutorial content attracts SaaS sponsors. The key difference from YouTube tech: Facebook audiences want tools that solve problems, not the latest gadgets — they are buyers, not enthusiasts. Tailor your sponsored content accordingly.',

        question: 'Do B2B companies sponsor tech Facebook creators?',
        answer:
          'Yes, and B2B sponsorships are the highest-paying category for tech creators on Facebook. SaaS companies (project management, CRM, accounting software), cybersecurity firms, cloud services, and business tools target Facebook because the platform reaches small business owners and professional decision-makers who do not frequent YouTube tech channels. Rates for B2B-focused tech content run 1.3–1.5x standard rates ($8–$24 per 1K followers). These deals often include per-trial-signup bonuses that can significantly boost total earnings. If your audience includes small business owners, freelancers, or managers, highlight these demographics in your media kit to attract B2B sponsorships.',

        answer:
          'Professional Facebook Groups (freelancer communities, small business owner groups, remote work communities) are premium sponsorship environments for tech products. Members actively seek tool recommendations and trust community input more than ads. Group-based tech sponsorships earn 1.5x standard rates because the audience is self-selected for professional tool interest. Effective formats include "tool of the week" recommendations, live demos within the group, and Q&A sessions featuring the sponsor\'s product. SaaS companies particularly value group sponsorships because the audience is ready to try new tools and the conversion rates justify the premium pricing.',

        question: 'How do tech Facebook rates compare to tech YouTube rates?',
        answer:
          'Tech Facebook rates ($6–$16 per 1K followers) are roughly one-quarter of YouTube tech rates ($35–$70 per 1K subscribers). YouTube tech content provides deep-dive reviews that directly drive high-ticket purchasing decisions, while Facebook tech content serves more of an advisory and practical-tools role. However, Facebook reaches professional decision-makers who do not follow tech YouTubers, making it uniquely valuable for B2B and productivity tools. The best strategy for tech creators is maintaining both platforms and offering cross-platform packages that give sponsors the depth of YouTube reviews plus the professional reach of Facebook content.',

    howItWorks:
      "Travel sponsorships on Facebook reach an audience that other platforms struggle to serve — older adults (35–65) with established careers, higher travel budgets, and more vacation time. While Instagram travel sells aspiration and TikTok travel sells spontaneity, Facebook travel sells planning. Destination reviews, trip itineraries, travel tips, and hotel comparison content perform well because Facebook's audience approaches travel methodically, researching destinations and accommodations before booking. Rates run $6–$16 per 1,000 followers, with destination and hotel review videos earning at the higher end. The primary sponsors include cruise lines (Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, Viking), all-inclusive resort chains (Sandals, Club Med), tourism boards targeting mature travelers, booking platforms (Booking.com, Expedia), travel insurance companies, and luggage brands. Cruise line sponsorships are particularly lucrative on Facebook because the platform's demographic is the core cruise market — adults 45+ with the time and budget for cruise vacations. Facebook travel Groups (destination-specific communities, cruise discussion groups, travel planning groups) are valuable sponsorship environments. Many Facebook travel creators also monetize through Facebook Live travel Q&A sessions, which attract tourism board and cruise line sponsors who want to engage directly with potential travelers. Seasonal patterns follow booking cycles: January–March for summer vacations, September–October for winter holidays and cruises.",

Deals typically include a complimentary cruise (valued at $2,000–$15,000 for a couple) plus cash fees and content deliverables (3–5 videos, daily Stories, a detailed review post).

Cruise line spending specifically peaks in January ("wave season" in the cruise industry, when lines offer the best deals and biggest marketing pushes). A secondary peak in September–October targets winter holiday and ski destination content. Facebook travel demand is more evenly distributed than TikTok because the older audience plans trips year-round, but the January–March window is clearly the strongest period for both rates and deal volume.',

Calculate your rate below.",
    howItWorks:
      "Entertainment on Facebook spans comedy videos, viral challenge content, nostalgia posts, commentary, and community engagement content. Per-follower rates are the lowest of any niche ($4–$10 per 1K) because the audience is broad and untargeted — brands are paying for reach and cultural presence rather than audience-specific purchase intent. However, Facebook entertainment content has a unique distribution advantage: shares. When a follower shares a funny video, it reaches their entire friend network, creating organic amplification that can push a sponsored video to 5–10x the creator's follower count. The primary sponsors are streaming services (Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime), movie studios promoting new releases, mobile games, food delivery apps, and mass-market consumer brands. Local businesses also sponsor Facebook entertainment creators more often than on any other platform, because Facebook's geographic targeting allows local businesses to reach community audiences. Facebook Watch and Facebook Reels provide additional monetization through ad revenue sharing, though rates are lower than YouTube's ad revenue. The key to earning premium entertainment sponsorship rates on Facebook is demonstrating shareability metrics — if your content is consistently shared at high rates, the effective reach far exceeds your follower count, and you should price accordingly.",

Local businesses are also a significant sponsor category on Facebook — local restaurants, auto dealers, and service providers partner with regional entertainment pages for community reach.

        answer:
          "Shares are Facebook entertainment's most powerful metric — unique to the platform in a way that does not exist on Instagram or TikTok at the same scale. When a follower shares your video, it appears in their friends' feeds, creating organic amplification. A highly shareable sponsored video from a 100K-follower page might reach 500K–1M viewers through shares alone. This viral mechanics make entertainment content on Facebook uniquely valuable despite the lower per-follower rates. Track your average shares-per-post and share-to-view ratio, and highlight these metrics in your media kit. Sponsors who understand Facebook's sharing dynamics will pay 20–30% more for creators with proven share rates.",

Local restaurants, car dealerships, gyms, entertainment venues, and service providers partner with regional entertainment pages and groups to reach community audiences. Rates for local sponsorships are lower ($100–$500 per post for smaller pages) but the deals are frequent and easy to produce. If your Facebook entertainment page has a strong regional following, build a local business sponsorship package — a bundle of 4–8 posts per month at a flat monthly rate of $300–$1,500 depending on your reach. This provides steady recurring income alongside occasional national brand deals.',

          'Facebook Watch offers ad revenue sharing for eligible video content — creators earn a share of revenue from ads shown in their longer-form videos (3+ minutes). While the CPM rates are lower than YouTube, Facebook Watch provides passive revenue on top of sponsorship income. To maximize Watch revenue, create longer-form entertainment content (3–10 minutes) that retains viewers past the first ad break. Facebook also offers in-stream ads for short-form content and Reels bonuses during promotional periods. Combining Watch ad revenue with sponsorship fees gives entertainment creators two income streams from the same content. The Watch program requires meeting follower, engagement, and content policy thresholds.',
