      'Beauty is one of the highest-demand sponsorship niches on YouTube. Tutorial creators, haul reviewers, and GRWM vloggers earn $25–$60 per 1,000 subscribers for integrations, with dedicated brand reviews reaching $50–$100 per 1K. Enter your channel stats to see your personalized rate.',
    howItWorks:
      'Beauty sponsorships on YouTube are driven by product demonstration — viewers watch tutorials, hauls, and GRWM (Get Ready With Me) videos specifically to see products in action before buying. This makes beauty creators uniquely valuable to brands like L\'Oréal, Charlotte Tilbury, Sephora, and direct-to-consumer skincare lines. A 60-second integration in a "favorites" or routine video typically earns $25–$60 per 1,000 subscribers because the product naturally fits the content. Dedicated review videos command $50–$100 per 1K since the entire video serves as a product showcase. Haul videos — where creators show multiple products from a brand or retailer — sit between these two, usually at 1.5x a standard integration. Beauty brands also frequently offer product seeding (free product) on top of the cash fee, and many deals include affiliate links through platforms like LTK (formerly rewardStyle) or Amazon Associates, adding 5–15% commission on sales. One important factor: luxury beauty brands (Chanel, Dior, La Mer) pay substantially more than drugstore brands, sometimes 3–5x, because they are targeting a high-income audience and protecting brand prestige. Engagement rate matters more in beauty than almost any other niche — a creator with 50K subscribers and 8% engagement will out-earn one with 200K subscribers and 1% engagement, because brands need viewers who trust the creator\'s product recommendations enough to purchase.',

        question: 'How much do beauty YouTubers charge for a sponsored tutorial?',
        answer:
          "Beauty tutorial sponsorships on YouTube typically cost brands $25–$60 per 1,000 subscribers for an integrated mention within a routine, favorites, or Get Ready With Me video. Dedicated tutorial videos — where the entire video focuses on one brand's products — command $50–$100 per 1K subscribers. A creator with 100K subscribers might charge $2,500–$6,000 for an integration or $5,000–$10,000 for a dedicated tutorial. These rates reflect the high purchase intent of beauty tutorial viewers, who often watch specifically to decide whether to buy a product.",

        question:
          'Do luxury beauty brands pay more than drugstore brands for YouTube sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Yes, significantly. Luxury beauty brands (Chanel, Dior, La Mer, Estée Lauder) typically pay 3–5x more than mass-market brands for YouTube sponsorships. A mid-tier beauty creator might earn $1,500 from a drugstore brand integration but $5,000–$8,000 from a luxury brand for similar deliverables. Luxury brands pay premiums because they need creators with an audience that matches their price point, and they are more protective of brand image — meaning they are pickier about which creators they work with, which drives up rates for those who qualify.',

        question: 'What types of beauty YouTube sponsorships pay the most?',
        answer:
          'Dedicated product reviews pay the highest rates (2–3x a standard integration) because the entire video serves as brand content. "Get Ready With Me" integrations and monthly favorites videos are the most common format, earning standard rates. Haul videos — showcasing multiple products from one brand or retailer — earn about 1.5x standard rates. Brand trip content (where a brand flies creators to an event or launch) often includes a flat fee plus travel expenses, totaling $5,000–$25,000 depending on creator size. Skincare routine videos tend to command slightly higher rates than makeup tutorials because skincare products have higher margins and customer lifetime values.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How important is engagement rate for beauty YouTube sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Engagement rate is arguably the most important metric for beauty sponsorships on YouTube, more so than subscriber count. Beauty brands measure ROI through product sales, which requires viewers who trust the creator enough to purchase. A creator with 50K subscribers and 7% engagement will typically earn more per sponsorship than one with 200K subscribers and 1% engagement. Brands also look at comment sentiment — if viewers regularly ask "what shade are you wearing?" or "where did you buy that?", it signals high purchase intent. Many beauty brands request engagement data and audience demographics before offering deals.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Should beauty YouTubers charge extra for affiliate links in sponsored videos?',
        answer:
          'Affiliate links and sponsorship fees are typically negotiated together, not separately. Most beauty brands offer a base sponsorship fee plus affiliate commission (usually 5–15% through LTK, Amazon Associates, or brand-direct programs). Some creators accept lower upfront fees in exchange for higher commission rates if they are confident in their conversion ability. For newer creators, affiliate-only deals (no upfront fee) are common as a way to build a track record with brands. Once you can demonstrate strong conversion rates, you gain leverage to negotiate higher base fees on future deals. Always negotiate usage rights separately — if a brand wants to run your video as a paid ad, that should cost 50–200% extra.',

    howItWorks:
      "Fashion sponsorships on YouTube revolve around visual styling content — try-on hauls, lookbook videos, outfit-of-the-day compilations, and seasonal wardrobe guides. Brands like ASOS, Zara, Revolve, and direct-to-consumer labels partner with fashion creators because video lets viewers see how clothes fit, move, and style together in ways that product photos cannot. A standard integration (60–90 seconds within a broader haul or styling video) earns $20–$50 per 1,000 subscribers. Try-on haul videos dedicated to a single brand command higher rates — typically 1.5–2x — because every item shown is from the sponsor. Seasonal content drives pricing cycles: back-to-school (August), holiday party dressing (November–December), and spring/summer transitions (March–April) see rates spike 20–30% as brands compete for creator slots. Fashion is also one of the strongest niches for affiliate revenue on top of sponsorship fees. Creators commonly earn 10–20% commission through programs like LTK, ShopMy, or brand-direct affiliate links, and top creators negotiate minimum guarantees plus commission. One key difference from beauty: fashion sponsorships are more dependent on the creator's personal style and aesthetic matching the brand identity. A streetwear creator and a luxury fashion creator with identical subscriber counts will attract completely different brands at very different price points.",

Seasonal lookbooks (holiday outfits, vacation wardrobes, capsule collections) also command premium rates because they are evergreen content that continues driving sales for months. "Styling X brand" videos where a creator builds multiple outfits from one retailer sit at about 1.5x standard rates.

          'Luxury fashion brands (Gucci, Prada, Net-a-Porter) pay 2–4x more than fast-fashion brands (SHEIN, H&M, Zara) for similar deliverables, but they are far more selective about which creators they work with. A luxury partnership might pay $8,000–$15,000 for a single video for a 100K-subscriber creator, while a fast-fashion brand might offer $2,000–$4,000. However, fast-fashion brands sponsor more frequently and are more open to smaller creators, making them a more consistent revenue source. Mid-range brands (Revolve, & Other Stories, COS) often offer the best value: competitive rates with less restrictive creative briefs.',

        question: 'Do fashion YouTubers earn affiliate commissions on top of sponsorship fees?',
        answer:
          'Yes, and fashion is one of the strongest niches for affiliate stacking. Most fashion sponsorship deals include both a flat fee and affiliate links through platforms like LTK (formerly rewardStyle), ShopMy, or brand-direct programs. Commission rates typically run 10–20% of attributed sales. Top fashion creators negotiate minimum guarantees — for example, a $3,000 flat fee plus 15% commission with a $1,000 minimum guarantee on affiliate earnings. This structure benefits both parties: the brand pays for performance, and the creator has downside protection. Always disclose both the sponsorship and affiliate relationship in your video.',

        question: 'How does personal style affect fashion sponsorship rates on YouTube?',
        answer:
          'Personal style is the single biggest differentiator in fashion sponsorship pricing. Two creators with identical subscriber counts and engagement rates will command very different rates depending on their aesthetic and the brands it attracts. A streetwear creator attracts Nike, Supreme, and sneaker brands. A minimalist fashion creator attracts COS, Everlane, and Uniqlo. A luxury fashion creator attracts Net-a-Porter and designer brands. The more niche and consistent your style, the more valuable you are to brands that serve that specific audience — even if your subscriber count is smaller. Brands pay premiums for audience-brand alignment because it drives higher conversion rates.',

Dedicated financial product reviews can earn $70–$120 per 1K. Calculate your rate below.',
    howItWorks:
      'Finance sponsorships on YouTube pay the highest rates of any content niche because of customer lifetime value economics. When a fintech like Wealthfront, a brokerage like Public or Webull, or an insurance company acquires a customer through a creator, that customer generates revenue for years — sometimes decades. A single credit card signup can be worth $200–$500 to the issuer, and a new investment account can be worth thousands over its lifetime. This justifies spending $40–$80 per 1,000 subscribers for a standard integration, and $70–$120 per 1K for dedicated review videos. The most common finance sponsorship formats are: app walkthroughs (showing how a platform works), portfolio discussions (where a creator explains their investing strategy while mentioning the sponsor), and personal finance advice videos with a sponsor tie-in. Deal types vary significantly — credit card companies and lending platforms often pay on a cost-per-acquisition (CPA) basis on top of a flat fee, offering $50–$150 per signup through a tracked link. Tax season (January–April) and open enrollment (October–December) are peak pricing periods for finance creators. One critical consideration: finance sponsorships carry regulatory sensitivity. The FTC and SEC scrutinize financial product endorsements, so creators need clear disclaimers and should never make specific return promises. Brands that navigate this well (NerdWallet, SoFi, Betterment) tend to build long-term creator relationships with annual contracts rather than one-off deals.',
    faq: [
      {
        question: 'Why do finance YouTubers earn the highest sponsorship rates?',
        answer:
          'Finance sponsorships pay the most because of customer lifetime value (LTV). A new banking customer might generate $500–$2,000 in revenue over their relationship with the bank. A new investment account can generate thousands in management fees over decades. An insurance policy renewal pays the company every year. Because each converted viewer is worth so much, finance brands — fintechs, brokerages, credit card companies, insurance providers — can afford to pay $40–$80 per 1,000 subscribers, roughly 2x the YouTube baseline. This math does not apply in most other niches where the value of a single customer conversion is lower.',

A typical structure is a flat fee of $40–$80 per 1,000 subscribers for a 60–90 second integration, plus $50–$150 per signup or account opening through a tracked referral link. For example, a 100K-subscriber finance creator might receive a $5,000 flat fee plus $100 per new brokerage account opened, with top performers earning $10,000+ on a single video when signups are strong. Dedicated review videos (full-video deep dives into a financial product) command 2–3x the flat fee. Some brands also offer revenue-share models where creators earn a percentage of assets under management referred through their link.',

      {
        question: 'When is the best time to negotiate finance sponsorships on YouTube?',
        answer:
          'Finance sponsorship demand peaks during two periods: tax season (January–April), when tax software companies (TurboTax, H&R Block), accounting tools, and financial planning platforms compete for creator slots; and open enrollment season (October–December), when insurance companies and benefits platforms increase budgets. Back-to-school season (August–September) also brings student loan refinancing and banking sponsors targeting young adults. January is particularly lucrative because "new year, new financial goals" content aligns naturally with fintech sponsors. Rates during peak periods can be 30–50% higher than mid-year averages because demand exceeds creator supply.',

      {
        question: 'Are there compliance risks with finance sponsorships on YouTube?',
        answer:
          'Yes, finance is the most compliance-sensitive sponsorship niche. The FTC requires clear disclosure of any sponsored relationship, and the SEC has specific rules about endorsements of investment products. Never make guaranteed return promises ("you will earn 10% annually"), and always include risk disclaimers when discussing investment products. Reputable finance brands (NerdWallet, SoFi, Betterment, Wealthfront) provide creators with approved talking points and required disclaimers. Creators who develop a track record of compliance and responsible content tend to earn more because compliance-conscious brands seek them out for long-term partnerships rather than risky one-off deals.',

The tradeoff is that finance content typically grows more slowly than entertainment or lifestyle content, so finance creators tend to have smaller subscriber counts. A 50K-subscriber finance channel is considered very successful, while a 50K entertainment channel is still relatively small. The combination of high per-subscriber rates and smaller audiences means finance creators often earn comparable total sponsorship revenue to much larger channels in other niches.',

    howItWorks:
      'Fitness sponsorships on YouTube are driven by a health-conscious audience with high purchase intent for supplements, workout equipment, athleisure clothing, and training programs. Brands like Gymshark, MyProtein, Athletic Greens (AG1), Peloton, and dozens of supplement companies compete for creator partnerships because fitness audiences trust their favorite creators\' product recommendations — they literally put these products in their bodies or use them daily. Standard integrations (mentioning a supplement during a workout routine or wearing a brand during a training video) earn $25–$55 per 1,000 subscribers. Dedicated supplement reviews and "what I eat in a day" sponsored by a nutrition brand earn 2x because the entire video is product-focused. Equipment reviews — home gym setups, treadmill comparisons, wearable fitness trackers — also command premium rates because they influence high-ticket purchases ($200–$2,000+). January is by far the most lucrative month for fitness sponsorships, with "new year, new you" campaigns driving budgets 40–60% above average. Supplement brands often structure deals as flat fee plus affiliate — typically $30–$50 per 1K subscribers upfront with 15–25% recurring commission on sales through a custom discount code (the classic "use code CREATOR for 20% off"). This commission can meaningfully add to total earnings, especially for creators with loyal audiences who reorder monthly.

The flat fee is typically in line with standard integration rates ($25–$55 per 1K subscribers), but the per-install bonus ($2–$10 per app download through a tracked link) can significantly increase total earnings. App sponsors also tend to offer longer trial periods for the creator's audience (30–90 days free), which increases conversion rates.

Kitchen equipment brands (KitchenAid, Our Place, Ninja) sponsor dedicated review and "cook with me" content at higher rates — $40–$80 per 1K — because a single review can drive purchases of $100–$400 items. Grocery and food brands (condiments, snacks, specialty ingredients) are growing their YouTube sponsorship spend, often targeting recipe creators to demonstrate their product as a key ingredient. Food content is uniquely evergreen — recipe videos continue generating views and affiliate revenue for years after upload, which means a sponsored recipe video delivers extended value to the brand. This gives food creators leverage to charge slightly above standard rates. Holiday cooking content (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Super Bowl) sees the biggest rate spikes, with November–December sponsorship rates running 25–35% above average.

        answer:
          'Food sponsorship rates peak during three periods: the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season (November–December), when rates climb 25–35% as food brands, kitchen equipment companies, and meal kit services increase budgets; Super Bowl week, when snack and beverage brands spike spending; and back-to-school season (August–September), when meal planning and lunchbox content drives partnerships. January also sees elevated activity from health-focused food brands (meal prep services, organic food companies) targeting "new year, healthy eating" audiences. Mid-summer (June–July) is typically the slowest period for food sponsorships.',

        question: 'How does recipe content being evergreen affect food sponsorship pricing?',
        answer:
          'Food content is among the most evergreen on YouTube — recipe videos routinely generate views for 3–5 years after upload, which means a sponsored recipe continues delivering brand impressions long after the campaign ends. This gives food creators real leverage in rate negotiations. You can justifiably charge 10–20% above standard niche rates by pointing out the extended shelf life of your content compared to trend-driven niches. Some food creators negotiate usage windows into their contracts — granting the brand 6 months of usage rights initially, then renegotiating or charging renewal fees if the brand wants continued association with the video.',

      'Tech is the second highest-paying sponsorship niche on YouTube. Hardware companies, SaaS platforms, VPN services, and consumer electronics brands pay $35–$70 per 1,000 subscribers for integrations because tech audiences have high purchasing power and purchase intent. Calculate your rate below.',
    howItWorks:
      'Tech sponsorships on YouTube command premium rates because tech audiences actively research products before making high-value purchases ($200–$2,000+), and creator reviews directly influence buying decisions. The tech sponsorship ecosystem has several distinct layers. VPN services (NordVPN, Surfshark, ExpressVPN) and productivity tools (Notion, Squarespace, Skillshare) are the most common sponsors, offering standardized deals at $35–$55 per 1,000 subscribers with tracked referral links. These companies sponsor across many niches but pay more for tech-focused channels where the audience is more likely to convert. Hardware companies (Samsung, OnePlus, Anker, Logitech) sponsor product reviews and unboxing videos at premium rates — $50–$100 per 1K — because a positive review from a trusted creator can drive millions in sales. These deals often include product seeding and early access to unreleased products. Enterprise SaaS companies (cloud services, developer tools, cybersecurity platforms) represent the highest-paying tier, sometimes offering $80–$150 per 1K subscribers for B2B-focused tech channels, because acquiring a single enterprise customer can be worth $10,000–$100,000+ annually. Comparison and "best of" videos command the highest rates because they influence purchase decisions at the moment of highest intent. Q4 (holiday shopping season) is the peak period for consumer tech sponsorships, with rates rising 30–40% as brands compete for pre-Black Friday review slots.',

        question: 'How much do tech YouTubers charge for product review sponsorships?',
        answer:
          'Dedicated product review videos on tech YouTube channels typically earn $50–$100 per 1,000 subscribers — about 1.5–2x the rate of a standard integration. For a 100K-subscriber tech channel, that means $5,000–$10,000 per review. These rates are high because a single review can directly influence thousands of purchasing decisions for products costing $200–$2,000+. "Best of" and comparison videos (e.g., "best laptops for 2026") command the highest end of this range because they capture viewers at peak purchase intent. Hardware companies also typically provide the review unit for free, which adds value on top of the cash fee.',

Hardware sponsorships from consumer electronics brands (Samsung, Apple ecosystem accessories, Logitech) are less frequent but pay more — $50–$100 per 1K — because they need dedicated review content for specific products. The key difference is volume vs. value: VPN deals come often but pay baseline rates, while hardware deals come less frequently but pay premium rates per video. Most tech creators earn from both categories.',

Companies selling cloud services, developer tools, cybersecurity solutions, and enterprise software pay $80–$150 per 1,000 subscribers for channels that reach IT professionals, developers, and business decision-makers. The rates are extreme because acquiring a single enterprise customer can be worth $10,000–$100,000+ annually. These sponsorships are rare and selective — brands look for channels with professional audiences, demonstrated expertise, and content that aligns with their buyer persona. If your audience skews toward developers or IT professionals, actively pitch B2B SaaS companies rather than waiting for inbound offers.',

Rates increase 30–40% above baseline during this period. Samsung, Apple ecosystem accessories, gaming hardware, and PC component brands all spike spending. CES (early January) creates a secondary peak for tech creators who cover new product announcements. Summer months (June–August) tend to be the slowest period for consumer tech sponsorships, though enterprise SaaS sponsorships remain more consistent year-round because business purchasing decisions are less seasonal.',

        question: 'Should tech YouTubers accept sponsored reviews or only independent ones?',
        answer:
          'This is the central tension in tech YouTube sponsorships. Audiences value honest, independent reviews — and any perception of bias can damage creator credibility permanently. The most sustainable approach is to maintain editorial independence within sponsored reviews: accept the sponsorship fee and product, but retain full control over your opinion and final edit. Reputable hardware brands (Samsung, Sony, Logitech) generally accept this arrangement because they are confident in their products. Brands that require a positive review or editorial approval should be avoided or charged a significant premium (3–5x standard rates) for what is essentially branded content. Many top tech creators also clearly distinguish between "sponsored by" and "sent for review" to maintain audience trust.',

Calculate your rate below.',
    howItWorks:
      'Travel sponsorships on YouTube operate differently from most niches because a significant portion of compensation comes as in-kind value rather than cash. Tourism boards fly creators to destinations and cover accommodation, meals, and activities — trips valued at $2,000–$20,000 — in exchange for one or more videos. Hotels provide complimentary stays worth $500–$5,000. Airlines offer business or first-class tickets. On top of this in-kind value, cash fees range from $30–$60 per 1,000 subscribers for a standard integration and $60–$100 per 1K for dedicated destination or hotel review videos. Booking platforms (Booking.com, Expedia, Hostelworld) and travel insurance companies operate more like traditional sponsors, offering flat fees plus affiliate commissions ($5–$20 per booking through a tracked link). Travel gear brands (luggage, backpacks, travel accessories) sponsor review and packing videos at standard-to-premium rates. The travel niche is highly seasonal: January–March is peak booking season when brands spend the most on creator partnerships for summer destinations. September–October sees a second spike for winter holiday and ski season content. Mid-summer (July–August) is paradoxically slower for new deals because brands have already locked in their summer campaigns. One unique challenge for travel creators: production costs are higher than other niches because you need to travel to create content, so factor your travel costs into sponsorship negotiations even when the brand is not covering them.',

        question: 'How do tourism board sponsorships work on YouTube?',
        answer:
          'Tourism boards (Visit Iceland, Tourism Australia, Discover Puerto Rico) partner with travel YouTubers to produce destination content that inspires travel bookings. These deals typically include a fully covered press trip — flights, accommodation, meals, activities, and a local guide — valued at $2,000–$20,000 depending on the destination and trip length. On top of the trip value, cash fees range from $3,000–$15,000+ per video depending on channel size and production quality. Deliverables usually include 1–3 YouTube videos plus social media coverage. Tourism boards plan 6–12 months ahead, so pitch in January for summer campaigns and in July for winter campaigns.',

      {
        question:
          'Should travel YouTubers count press trip value as part of their sponsorship rate?',
        answer:
          'Yes, but be strategic about it. A press trip worth $10,000 in flights, hotels, and experiences has real value, but it is not cash in your pocket — and it comes with content creation obligations that cost you time and production resources. When negotiating, value the trip at roughly 50% of its retail price for rate calculation purposes. If a tourism board offers a $10,000 trip, consider that equivalent to about $5,000 in cash compensation and negotiate additional cash fees on top if your standard rate exceeds that amount. Never accept a press trip as full compensation if you would normally charge more — the trip is a production cost for the brand, not a generous gift.',

        question: 'How much do hotel sponsorships pay travel YouTubers?',
        answer:
          'Hotel sponsorships range from complimentary stays only (for smaller creators) to $2,000–$10,000 cash plus a free stay for mid-to-large channels. Luxury hotel chains (Four Seasons, Aman, Ritz-Carlton) pay the most because they target affluent travelers and need aspirational content. Budget and mid-range chains (Marriott, Hilton, IHG) offer more volume but lower per-deal rates. A dedicated hotel review video typically earns $40–$80 per 1,000 subscribers in cash, plus the stay itself. Booking platforms (Booking.com, Hotels.com) offer a different model: flat sponsorship fees plus $5–$15 per booking through affiliate links, which can generate significant passive income from evergreen travel content.',

        question: 'When do travel YouTube sponsorship rates peak?',
        answer:
          'Travel sponsorship spending peaks in January–March, when consumers are booking summer vacations and brands compete for creator partnerships during this high-intent planning window. Rates rise 20–30% above mid-year averages. A secondary peak occurs in September–October for winter holiday, ski season, and festive destination content. Interestingly, peak travel season itself (July–August) is relatively quiet for new sponsorship deals because brands have already committed their summer budgets. The lowest-earning months are November–December, when advertising budgets shift away from travel toward retail and holiday shopping. Year-round, cruise lines and all-inclusive resorts tend to be the most consistent sponsors.',

        question: 'How do travel YouTubers handle production costs in sponsorship negotiations?',

Smart travel creators build production costs into their base rate. If you are traveling to a destination on your own to create content that features a brand (a luggage review, a travel insurance integration), add 20–30% to your standard rate to cover flights, accommodation, and on-location production time. For self-funded trips where you will pitch sponsors after filming, shoot extra B-roll and alternate angles that can be offered to brands as usage-rights-included content, justifying higher rates.',

    howItWorks:
      'Entertainment is the broadest and most competitive sponsorship niche on YouTube, covering everything from gaming and comedy to reaction videos, commentary, and general variety content. Per-subscriber rates are lower than specialized niches ($15–$35 per 1K for integrations, $30–$60 per 1K for dedicated videos) because the audience is less targeted — a comedy viewer is less likely to convert on a specific product than a finance viewer researching investment platforms. However, entertainment creators typically have much larger audiences than niche creators, which means absolute sponsorship revenue can be comparable or higher. The most common entertainment sponsors are mass-market consumer brands: mobile games (Raid Shadow Legends, Rise of Kingdoms), VPN services, beverage companies, food delivery apps, and consumer electronics. Mobile game sponsorships are particularly prolific, paying $15–$30 per 1K subscribers for a 60-second gameplay integration — they are easy to produce and always available. Brand safety matters more in entertainment than in most niches. Comedy and commentary creators who use strong language, controversial topics, or edgy humor may find that some mass-market brands avoid them despite large audiences. Building a reputation as "brand-safe" can increase your deal flow significantly without requiring you to change your content — simply having a section of each video that is clean and brand-appropriate is usually sufficient. Gaming content within the entertainment niche has its own sub-economy: game publishers pay $20–$50 per 1K for sponsored gameplay, and gaming hardware brands (Razer, Corsair, HyperX) pay premium rates for dedicated reviews.',

        answer:
          'Entertainment content — comedy, gaming, reactions, commentary — attracts broad, diverse audiences rather than targeted ones. When a finance creator endorses a fintech app, many viewers are actively looking for financial products. When a comedy creator mentions the same app, fewer viewers are in the market. This lower purchase intent means brands get fewer conversions per impression, so they pay less per subscriber. Entertainment integrations typically earn $15–$35 per 1K subscribers, compared to $40–$80 for finance. However, entertainment creators often have 5–10x the subscriber count of niche creators, so total sponsorship revenue per video can be comparable.',

Creators who use excessive profanity, cover controversial topics, or produce edgy content may find that many mass-market brands decline to sponsor them regardless of audience size. This does not mean you need to sanitize your content — but having a brand-safe segment within each video (a clean 60–90 second window for an integration) can dramatically increase your sponsorship opportunities. Creators who proactively address brand safety in their media kit and pitch materials typically see 30–50% more inbound sponsorship inquiries.

These deals typically require the creator to download the game, play it on camera for 60–90 seconds, and highlight 2–3 features specified by the sponsor. For a 200K-subscriber entertainment channel, that is $3,000–$6,000 per video. Mobile game companies sponsor frequently and at high volume, making them a reliable income source — some creators do 2–3 mobile game sponsorships per month.

Since entertainment creators cannot offer niche audience targeting, focus instead on: audience size and reach metrics (total views, impressions, watch time), audience demographics (age, location, income data from YouTube Analytics), retention rates (proving viewers watch through the sponsored segment), and case studies from past campaigns showing click-through rates or conversions. Multi-video packages can also increase your effective rate — offering 3 integrations over a month at a slight per-video discount increases total deal value while giving the brand frequency and reinforcement. Entertainment creators with demonstrated conversion data often earn 30–50% above initial offers.',
