# Step 8: Landing Page Polish & SEO Copy

## Goal
Flesh out the landing page with proper SEO content, better design, and internal linking.

## Tasks

1. **Enhance hero section** — stronger CTA, maybe a subtle background gradient or pattern
2. **Calculator card grid** — add brief "what you'll learn" bullet points to each card
3. **SEO copy section** — "What is CreatiCalc?" paragraph below the fold targeting broad keywords:
   - "free calculator for content creators"
   - "youtube earnings calculator"
   - "social media engagement calculator"
4. **Social proof / stats section** — "Used by X creators" (can start with placeholder, update with real data later)
5. **Internal linking** — ensure every calculator links to every other calculator (already done via shared layout, verify)
6. **OG image** — create or generate an OG image for the landing page (can use a static image for MVP)
7. **Structured data** — add Organization schema to the landing page

## SEO targets
- "content creator calculators"
- "free youtube calculator"
- "creator tools free"
