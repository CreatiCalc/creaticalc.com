Two YouTube channels can have the exact same subscriber count, upload the same number of videos per week, and be in the same niche, yet one makes five times more money. The difference? Where their viewers are located.

Audience geography is one of the biggest factors in YouTube ad revenue, and most creators don't realize just how dramatic the gap is until they start digging into their analytics. A channel with 500,000 monthly views from the United States could earn $4,000–$7,000 from ads. The same 500,000 views from India or Indonesia? Closer to $300–$600. That's not a rounding error. It's a completely different business.

This guide breaks down [CPM](/glossary#cpm) rates by country, explains why the gaps exist, and covers what you can actually do about it.

## How YouTube CPM Works: A Quick Refresher

Before we get into the country data, a quick recap on the two metrics that matter.

**[CPM](/glossary#cpm) (Cost Per Mille)** is what advertisers pay per 1,000 ad [impressions](/glossary#impressions). This is the gross number, before YouTube takes its 45% cut. When you see people quoting high CPMs on Twitter, remember: that's not what hits your bank account.

**[RPM](/glossary#rpm) (Revenue Per Mille)** is what you actually earn per 1,000 total video views, after YouTube's cut and all those non-monetized views are factored in. RPM is always lower than CPM, and it's the number worth tracking.

The connection between them: YouTube runs a real-time auction every time an ad slot opens. Advertisers bid on your viewers based on demographics, interests, and location. When more advertisers compete for the same viewer, the CPM goes up. When fewer advertisers want that viewer (or they're bidding lower amounts), the CPM drops.

Geography matters so much because advertiser demand, budgets, and willingness to pay are wildly uneven across countries. A viewer in Norway is worth more to advertisers than a viewer in Bangladesh, not because of anything about those individuals, but because the advertising markets in those countries operate at completely different scales.

## CPM Rates by Country and Region (2026)

The table below shows estimated CPM and RPM ranges for 30+ countries, grouped into four tiers based on advertiser spending. These numbers reflect averages across niches. Your actual rates will vary depending on your content category (finance channels will be higher, music channels lower), the time of year, and your specific audience demographics within each country.

### Tier 1: Premium Markets ($20–$45 CPM)

These countries have the most competitive ad markets, with large advertiser bases and high purchasing power.

| Country | Estimated CPM (USD) | Estimated RPM (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $22–$38 | $8–$16 |
| Norway | $25–$45 | $10–$18 |
| Switzerland | $24–$42 | $9–$17 |
| Australia | $20–$36 | $8–$15 |
| Canada | $18–$32 | $7–$13 |
| United Kingdom | $18–$30 | $7–$12 |
| Germany | $17–$30 | $7–$12 |
| Denmark | $20–$35 | $8–$14 |
| Sweden | $18–$32 | $7–$13 |
| Austria | $17–$28 | $7–$11 |

The United States dominates YouTube ad revenue, not because its per-viewer CPM is always the highest (Norway and Switzerland often beat it), but because of sheer market size. The US has more advertisers spending more money on YouTube than any other country by a wide margin. That massive demand pool keeps CPMs consistently high across nearly every niche.

### Tier 2: Strong Markets ($10–$22 CPM)

Developed economies with mature digital ad markets, but smaller advertiser pools or less competition than Tier 1.

| Country | Estimated CPM (USD) | Estimated RPM (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| Netherlands | $14–$24 | $6–$10 |
| France | $12–$22 | $5–$9 |
| Japan | $12–$20 | $5–$8 |
| South Korea | $10–$18 | $4–$7 |
| Belgium | $13–$22 | $5–$9 |
| Finland | $14–$22 | $6–$9 |
| New Zealand | $13–$20 | $5–$8 |
| Ireland | $14–$22 | $6–$9 |
| Italy | $10–$18 | $4–$7 |
| Spain | $8–$16 | $3–$6 |
| Singapore | $10–$18 | $4–$7 |
| United Arab Emirates | $10–$20 | $4–$8 |

Japan and South Korea are interesting cases. Both have enormous digital economies, but much of the advertising spend stays within domestic platforms (LINE, Yahoo Japan, Naver, KakaoTalk). YouTube still pulls strong CPMs there, just not quite at the level you'd expect given their GDP.

### Tier 3: Emerging Markets ($4–$12 CPM)

Growing ad markets with increasing digital spend, but significantly less advertiser competition than Tier 1 or 2.

| Country | Estimated CPM (USD) | Estimated RPM (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| Brazil | $5–$12 | $2–$5 |
| Mexico | $4–$10 | $1.50–$4 |
| Poland | $6–$12 | $2.50–$5 |
| Turkey | $3–$8 | $1.20–$3 |
| Argentina | $3–$8 | $1.20–$3 |
| Saudi Arabia | $6–$14 | $2.50–$6 |
| Malaysia | $4–$9 | $1.50–$4 |
| Thailand | $3–$8 | $1.20–$3 |
| Colombia | $3–$7 | $1.20–$3 |
| Romania | $5–$10 | $2–$4 |

Brazil stands out in this tier. It has a large, active YouTube audience (the platform is massive there) and a growing digital ad market. Brazilian CPMs have been trending upward year over year, and some creators report rates approaching Tier 2 levels in high-value niches like finance and technology.

### Tier 4: Low-CPM Markets ($0.50–$5 CPM)

Large audiences but limited advertiser budgets. High view volumes here don't translate to proportionally high revenue.

| Country | Estimated CPM (USD) | Estimated RPM (USD) |
|---|---|---|
| India | $0.80–$3 | $0.30–$1.20 |
| Indonesia | $0.80–$3 | $0.30–$1.20 |
| Philippines | $0.60–$2.50 | $0.25–$1 |
| Vietnam | $0.50–$2 | $0.20–$0.80 |
| Pakistan | $0.50–$1.80 | $0.20–$0.70 |
| Bangladesh | $0.40–$1.50 | $0.15–$0.60 |
| Nigeria | $0.60–$2 | $0.25–$0.80 |
| Egypt | $0.50–$2 | $0.20–$0.80 |
| Kenya | $0.60–$2.50 | $0.25–$1 |

India is the most important market in this tier. It's YouTube's largest audience by user count (over 500 million monthly users), and creators targeting Indian audiences can generate massive view numbers. But the math is unforgiving: 1 million views from India at a $1.50 CPM generates about $1,500 gross, or roughly $600 after YouTube's cut. That same million views from the US at a $28 CPM? About $28,000 gross, netting $11,200. An 18x difference.

## Why CPMs Vary So Much by Country

The gap between a $35 CPM in Norway and a $1 CPM in Bangladesh isn't arbitrary. Four primary forces drive it.

### Advertiser Competition

YouTube ad placements are sold through a real-time auction. In countries with more advertisers bidding on the same inventory, prices get driven up. The United States alone accounts for roughly 40% of global digital ad spending. When thousands of advertisers are competing for the attention of a 30-year-old American viewer interested in personal finance, the winning bid is going to be high. In markets with fewer advertisers (or where brands allocate most of their budget to domestic platforms instead of YouTube), there's less competition and CPMs stay low.

### Purchasing Power and Ad Budgets

Advertisers set bids based on expected return. If the average viewer in a country has significant disposable income, advertisers can justify paying more to reach them because those viewers are more likely to buy their products. Norway, Switzerland, and the US consistently rank at the top of purchasing power indices, and their CPMs reflect that directly.

Conversely, in markets where consumer spending power is lower, advertisers can't justify the same per-impression costs. A $30 CPM only makes sense if there's a reasonable probability that those 1,000 viewers will generate enough purchases to justify the spend.

### Digital Ad Market Maturity

Some countries have well-developed digital advertising ecosystems where brands are comfortable spending large budgets on YouTube specifically. In others, digital ad spending is still catching up to traditional media (TV, print, outdoor), and YouTube gets a smaller share of a smaller pie. Markets like India and Indonesia are growing fast, but they started from a lower base, and CPMs are rising gradually rather than jumping overnight.

### Currency and Economic Factors

CPMs are ultimately denominated in local currency, then converted to USD for reporting. Currency fluctuations can affect reported CPM rates, particularly in countries with volatile currencies. When the Turkish lira or Argentine peso weakens against the dollar, the USD-equivalent CPM for those countries drops, even if local advertisers haven't actually changed their bids.

## How to Check Your Audience Geography

If you don't know where your viewers are, you're flying blind. YouTube Analytics makes this straightforward.

1. Open [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com) and go to **Analytics**
2. Click the **Audience** tab
3. Scroll to the **Top geographies** card, which shows a country-by-country breakdown of your viewers
4. For revenue-specific geography data, go to the **Revenue** tab and look at the **Geography** filter to see estimated revenue by country

Pay attention to the ratio between your view distribution and your revenue distribution. If 60% of your views come from India but only 8% of your revenue does, geography is the reason your earnings feel low relative to your view count.

You can also filter individual video analytics by geography. This is useful for identifying which videos attract higher-CPM audiences so you can make more content like them.

## Strategies for Increasing High-CPM Views

You can't control where people live, but you can influence which audiences discover your content. None of these strategies will flip your audience geography overnight, but applied consistently, they shift the balance over time.

### Produce Content in English

English-language content naturally attracts viewers from the US, UK, Canada, and Australia (all Tier 1 markets). If you're bilingual, publishing in English opens access to the highest-CPM audience pool on the platform. Some creators produce content in both their native language and English, essentially running two channels that target different audience tiers.

### Cover Topics with Strong US/UK Search Demand

Use tools like Google Trends, Ahrefs, or vidIQ to identify topics that US and UK audiences are actively searching for. Product reviews, "best of" lists for products available in Western markets, and how-to content addressing problems common in high-income countries tend to pull disproportionately from Tier 1 regions.

### Optimize Publishing Times

YouTube's algorithm favors videos that get strong early engagement. Publishing when your target high-CPM audience is most active gives your video the best shot at being recommended to more viewers in those regions. For US audiences, that generally means publishing between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM Eastern Time on weekdays. Check your YouTube Analytics real-time data to find the specific windows that work for your audience.

### Use Thumbnails and Titles That Resonate Across Cultures

If your thumbnails or titles rely on cultural references specific to one country, you're limiting your potential audience. Universally relatable content (clear visual storytelling, widely understood topics) travels better across borders.

### Diversify Revenue Beyond CPM

If your audience is primarily in Tier 3 or Tier 4 countries, fighting geography on CPM alone is an uphill battle. Instead, lean into revenue streams that aren't tied to ad rates: [sponsorships](/blog/how-to-calculate-sponsorship-rate), affiliate marketing, digital products, and memberships. Some brands specifically want to reach audiences in emerging markets, and they'll pay sponsorship rates that far exceed what AdSense generates on those same views.

### Consider YouTube Shorts Strategically

YouTube Shorts can expose your channel to new geographic audiences quickly. If your Shorts content is in English and taps into universally popular formats, the algorithm may distribute it to viewers in higher-CPM countries, who then subscribe and watch your long-form content. The Shorts revenue itself is minimal regardless of geography (learn more in our [comparison of TikTok vs YouTube pay](/blog/tiktok-vs-youtube-creator-pay)), but the subscriber funnel effect matters.

## Seasonality Compounds the Geography Effect

One factor that makes country-level CPM data even more complex: seasonality. CPMs in Tier 1 countries swing dramatically throughout the year, while Tier 4 countries see much smaller fluctuations.

During Q4 (October through December), US and UK CPMs can spike 30–80% as advertisers increase holiday spending. A US-heavy channel that earns $6,000 in January might pull in $10,000–$12,000 in November from the same view count. Meanwhile, a channel with mostly Indian or Indonesian viewers might see only a 5–15% Q4 bump.

This means the gap between high-CPM and low-CPM audiences actually widens during the most profitable time of year. If you're planning to push for more high-CPM viewers, timing that effort before Q4 maximizes the payoff.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which country has the highest YouTube CPM?

Norway and Switzerland consistently report the highest per-viewer CPMs, often reaching $25–$45 depending on the niche. The United States is close behind at $22–$38 and generates far more total revenue because of its larger audience and advertiser base. In high-value niches like personal finance, US CPMs can exceed $40.

### Why is YouTube CPM so low in India?

India's low CPMs come down to the economics of its advertising market. While India has over 500 million YouTube users, advertiser budgets are proportionally much smaller than in Western markets. Lower consumer purchasing power means advertisers can't justify high per-impression costs, and there's less competition for ad inventory. Indian CPMs are growing year over year, but the gap with Tier 1 countries remains substantial.

### Can I see CPM by country in YouTube Analytics?

Yes. In YouTube Studio, go to Analytics, then the Revenue tab. Use the Geography filter to break down estimated revenue by country. You can also see the Revenue Per Mille (RPM) metric by country, which shows what you're actually earning per 1,000 views from each location. Compare this to your Audience tab geography data to see how view distribution and revenue distribution differ.

### Does YouTube Shorts CPM vary by country too?

It does, though the variation is less dramatic than with long-form content. Shorts CPMs are extremely low across the board ($0.03–$0.10 per 1,000 views globally), and while there's still a gap between US and Indian Shorts views, the difference in absolute dollar terms is small. The bigger question with Shorts is whether they're bringing in subscribers who then watch your higher-earning long-form videos.

### How much does a million YouTube views pay in the US vs India?

Roughly speaking, 1 million views from US audiences at a mid-range $28 CPM generates about $28,000 gross, or around $11,200 after YouTube's 45% cut. The same 1 million views from India at a $1.50 CPM generates about $1,500 gross, netting around $600. That's roughly an 18x difference in take-home pay for the same view count.

### Should I avoid making content for low-CPM countries?

Not necessarily. Large audiences in Tier 3 and Tier 4 countries can still generate meaningful revenue at scale, and they're often easier to build because there's less competition from established creators. More importantly, ad revenue isn't the only way to monetize. Sponsorships, affiliate marketing, digital products, and memberships can all generate strong returns regardless of where your viewers are located. The smartest approach is to understand your audience geography, factor it into your revenue expectations, and diversify your income sources accordingly.
