You do not need 100,000 followers to land a paid [brand deal](/glossary#brand-deal). That number gets thrown around like it's some magic threshold, but the reality in 2026 looks very different. Brands are actively seeking out creators with 1,000 to 10,000 followers because those audiences are engaged, trusting, and far more likely to act on a recommendation than the followers of a mega-influencer who promotes a new product every other day.

If you've been waiting to "grow more" before pursuing sponsorships, you're leaving money on the table right now. This guide covers everything you need to land your first brand deal as a small creator: why brands want you, how to prepare, where to find opportunities, how to pitch, and what to charge.

## Why Brands Actively Seek Small Creators

The shift toward nano and micro-influencers isn't a trend. It's a structural change in how brands allocate marketing budgets.

A 2025 Influencer Marketing Hub report found that 44% of brands now prefer working with [nano-influencers](/glossary#influencer-tiers) (1K-10K followers), up from 39% the year before. The reason is straightforward: small creators deliver better results per dollar spent. Nano-influencers on Instagram average a 4% to 8% [engagement rate](/glossary#engagement-rate), while accounts over 1 million followers typically sit below 1.5%. That's a 3x to 5x difference in the metric that actually predicts whether someone will click, buy, or sign up.

There's more to it than just numbers, though. When a creator with 5,000 followers recommends a product, it reads like advice from a friend. When a creator with 2 million followers does the same, it reads like an ad. Audiences can feel the difference, and brands have the data to prove it. Conversion rates for nano-influencer campaigns regularly outperform macro-influencer campaigns by 20% to 60%, according to data from platforms like Aspire and CreatorIQ.

Small creators also cost a fraction of what larger accounts charge. A brand might spend $50,000 on a single post from a macro-influencer, or spread that same budget across 50 to 100 nano-influencers covering different audience segments and geographic markets. The second approach generates more total engagement, more authentic content, and more data points to optimize future campaigns. Brands have figured this out, and the money is flowing accordingly.

## Preparing Your Profile for Brand Outreach

Before you pitch anyone, your profile needs to look like a creator who takes their work seriously. Brands will check. Here's what they're actually looking at.

### Clean Up Your Bio and Feed

Your bio should clearly state what you do, who your content is for, and include a professional email or link. "DM for collabs" buried in a cluttered bio doesn't cut it. Something like "Helping busy parents cook healthy weeknight dinners | Partner inquiries: you@email.com" tells a brand exactly what they're getting.

Your feed should look cohesive. That doesn't mean every post needs identical color grading, but there should be a recognizable style and topic consistency across your last 12 to 20 posts. If your grid is a random mix of selfies, memes, food shots, and political commentary, a brand has no idea what working with you would look like. Niche focus is your biggest advantage as a small creator. Lean into it.

### Build a Simple Media Kit

A [media kit](/glossary#media-kit) is a one-page PDF that summarizes your value as a creator. It signals professionalism and makes the brand's decision easier. You don't need a designer for this. Canva has free templates that work fine. Include:

- **Your name, handle, and platforms** with follower counts
- **Your niche** in one sentence
- **Engagement rate** (calculate yours with our [Instagram engagement rate calculator](/instagram-engagement-rate-calculator) or [engagement rate calculator](/engagement-rate-calculator))
- **Audience demographics**: age range, gender split, top locations (pull these from your platform analytics)
- **Content samples**: 3 to 4 of your best posts, ideally ones that already look like they could be brand content
- **Contact information**: professional email, not your personal one

You don't need past brand partnerships to have a media kit. Brands evaluating nano-influencers know they might be your first partner. What they care about is whether your audience matches their target customer and whether your content quality meets their standards.

### Optimize Your Engagement Rate

Your engagement rate is the number that determines whether a brand sees "small but mighty" or just "small." Above 4% on Instagram or above 6% on TikTok puts you in strong territory for your tier. If you're below those benchmarks, spend a few weeks improving before you start pitching. Our guide on [what is a good engagement rate](/blog/what-is-a-good-engagement-rate) covers the benchmarks and improvement tactics in detail.

Quick wins: respond to every comment, post carousel or multi-slide content (which consistently outperforms single images), use calls to action in your captions, and remove ghost followers dragging your rate down.

## Where to Find Brand Deal Opportunities

Once your profile is ready, you need to actually find brands willing to work with nano and micro-creators. There are four main channels, and you should be using all of them.

### Influencer Platforms and Marketplaces

These platforms connect brands with creators and handle much of the logistics. Most are free for creators to join.

- **Aspire (formerly AspireIQ)**: One of the largest platforms. Brands post campaigns, you apply, and Aspire handles contracts and payments. Strong for lifestyle, beauty, food, and fitness niches.
- **Creator.co**: Built specifically for micro and nano-influencers. Lower follower requirements than most platforms, and the campaign matching is solid.
- **Grin**: More brand-facing, but brands using Grin often search for smaller creators through the platform's discovery tools. Worth having a presence on.
- **Collabstr**: A marketplace where you set your rate and brands come to you. Good for building initial traction.
- **Instagram and TikTok Creator Marketplaces**: Both platforms now have built-in marketplaces where brands can browse and contact creators directly. Make sure your profile is opted into these (check your account settings under "Creator" or "Business" tools).

Sign up for at least three of these. The more discoverable you are, the more inbound opportunities you'll get, and inbound is always easier to close than cold outreach.

### Direct Outreach to Brands

This is the highest-effort channel but also the one that gives you the most control over which brands you work with. Small, direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are your best targets. They have marketing budgets but can't afford mega-influencers, and they're actively looking for authentic creators who genuinely use their products.

Look for brands that:

- Already work with creators in your niche (check their tagged posts and branded hashtags)
- Sell products you actually use or would genuinely recommend
- Are growing but aren't massive household names yet (these brands are the hungriest for creator partnerships)
- Have an active social media presence showing they value content marketing

Compile a list of 20 to 30 brands that fit these criteria. You'll pitch them in the next section.

### PR and Talent Agencies

Some PR agencies represent brands that specifically want to work with smaller creators. If you build relationships with PR contacts in your niche, you can get on their lists for upcoming campaigns. Follow brand PR accounts, engage with their content, and don't be afraid to email them directly asking to be considered for future creator campaigns.

### Networking With Other Creators

Other creators in your niche are one of your best resources for finding brand deals. When a creator turns down a deal because the budget is too low for their tier, they'll often refer the brand to a smaller creator they know. Join creator communities on Discord, Facebook Groups, or Slack. The referral pipeline is real, and it only works if people know who you are.

## How to Pitch Brands (Without Sounding Desperate)

Cold pitching is uncomfortable. But a well-crafted pitch email converts at a surprisingly high rate when it's targeted, specific, and short.

### The Pitch Email Structure

Keep your email under 200 words. Brand marketing managers read hundreds of emails a week. Respect their time.

**Subject line:** Keep it specific and benefit-oriented. "Partnership idea: [your niche] content for [brand name]" works better than "Collab opportunity!!!!"

**Opening (2 sentences):** Mention the brand by name, reference a specific product or campaign of theirs, and explain why you're reaching out. This proves you're not sending a mass email.

**Your value (3-4 sentences):** State your platform, niche, follower count, and engagement rate. Mention one or two things that make your audience a good fit for their brand. If your audience demographics strongly overlap with their target customer, say that.

**The ask (1-2 sentences):** Propose a specific collaboration format. "I'd love to create a Reel featuring [product] for my audience of [niche description]" is better than "I'd love to work together!" Specificity shows you've thought about how the partnership would actually work.

**Close:** Attach your media kit, thank them, and include your contact info.

### Common Mistakes That Kill Pitches

- **Being too generic.** "I love your brand and would love to collab!" tells the recipient nothing. Reference specific products, campaigns, or brand values.
- **Leading with your follower count.** If you have 3,000 followers, don't make that the first thing they read. Lead with your engagement rate, your niche expertise, or your audience demographics.
- **Asking for free products instead of payment.** You can accept gifted products early on (more on that below), but your pitch should position you as a professional, not a freebie hunter.
- **Not following up.** Most pitches don't get a response on the first email. A polite follow-up 5 to 7 days later doubles your response rate. One follow-up is professional. Three is annoying.

## Setting Your Rate: Don't Work for Free

This is where most small creators stumble. Someone with 3,000 followers might think they can't charge anything. That's wrong. You can and should set a real [sponsorship rate](/glossary#sponsorship-rate) and charge for your work, even at a small scale.

### Finding Your Starting Rate

The standard formula for Instagram is roughly $10 per 1,000 followers as a starting baseline for a feed post, with Reels commanding 1.5x to 2x that. For TikTok, rates start around $5 to $15 per 1,000 followers depending on engagement.

So a creator with 5,000 Instagram followers and a 6% engagement rate could reasonably charge:

- **Feed post:** $50 to $100
- **Reel:** $100 to $200
- **Story set (3 slides):** $25 to $75
- **Bundle (Reel + Stories):** $125 to $250

These aren't huge numbers, but they're real compensation for real work. And they set a baseline you can raise as you grow. Our [sponsorship rate calculator](/sponsorship-rate-calculator) will give you a more personalized estimate based on your exact metrics.

### When Gifted Collaborations Make Sense

Product-only deals get a bad reputation, and sometimes deservedly so. But for creators under 5,000 followers, accepting 2 to 3 gifted collaborations early on can be a strategic move. You build a portfolio of branded content that looks professional in your media kit, you develop a working relationship with a brand that may convert to paid deals later, and you practice the entire collaboration workflow (briefing, creating, delivering, reporting).

The key distinction: take gifted deals only from brands you'd genuinely recommend, only for products worth at least $50 to $100, and never agree to more than a couple before transitioning to paid work. If a brand with a $200 product asks for three Reels, two Stories, and a feed post in exchange for the product alone, that's exploitation, not a collaboration.

For a deeper dive into the math behind pricing, our guide on [how to calculate your sponsorship rate](/blog/how-to-calculate-sponsorship-rate) walks through every formula brands use, and knowing those formulas helps you negotiate from an informed position. You can also check [Instagram sponsorship rates by follower count](/blog/instagram-sponsorship-rates-by-follower-count) to see where your tier falls in the broader market.

## Negotiating and Closing the Deal

You've pitched, a brand is interested, and now it's time to actually close. A few things to get right here.

### Contracts Matter, Even for Small Deals

Every paid collaboration should have written terms. This doesn't need to be a 10-page legal document. A clear email or simple contract covering the following points works fine:

- **Deliverables**: exactly what content you'll create (format, quantity, platforms)
- **Timeline**: due dates for drafts, revisions, and final posting
- **Payment amount and terms**: how much, when you get paid, and via what method (PayPal, bank transfer, etc.)
- **Revision rounds**: how many rounds of brand feedback are included (one to two is standard)
- **[Usage rights](/glossary#usage-rights)**: whether the brand can repost your content on their channels, use it in ads, or feature it on their website
- **Exclusivity**: whether you're restricted from working with competing brands, and for how long

### Usage Rights and Exclusivity: Don't Give These Away

Two terms that brands sometimes slip into agreements without drawing attention to them. [Usage rights](/glossary#usage-rights) determine what the brand can do with your content after you post it. If they want to run your Reel as a paid ad reaching millions of additional people, that's a separate license worth additional money, typically 25% to 100% on top of your base rate.

Exclusivity means you agree not to promote competing products for a set period. For a nano-influencer, even a 30-day exclusivity window limits your earning potential. Charge for it: 15% to 30% on top of your base rate is reasonable for a 30-day window at the nano and micro tier.

### Payment Terms

Get at least 50% upfront before you create any content. For smaller deals (under $500), asking for full payment upfront or upon content delivery is standard. Net-30 or net-60 payment terms (meaning the brand pays 30 or 60 days after you invoice) are common with larger brands and agencies. Accept them if you must, but always get the terms in writing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many followers do I need to start getting brand deals?

There's no hard minimum. Brands have worked with creators who have as few as 500 to 1,000 followers, especially in tight niches like local food, specialty hobbies, or B2B topics. The practical threshold where inbound opportunities start appearing is around 1,000 to 3,000 followers with a strong engagement rate (above 5% on Instagram, above 7% on TikTok). Below that, you'll likely need to do all outbound pitching yourself.

### How much should I charge for my first brand deal?

The "Setting Your Rate" section above covers this in detail, but the quick version: start at roughly $10 per 1,000 followers for an Instagram feed post. Use our [sponsorship rate calculator](/sponsorship-rate-calculator) to get a number tailored to your specific metrics. The most important thing is to charge *something* from the start so you don't anchor future negotiations at zero.

### Should I accept free products instead of payment?

Only as a short-term portfolio builder. Cap gifted deals at 2-3 collaborations, accept only products you'd genuinely recommend, and transition to paid partnerships as soon as you have content samples to show. If a brand keeps offering product-only after you've demonstrated strong engagement, they're not valuing your work appropriately.

### What's the best platform for small creators to get sponsorships?

Instagram and TikTok are the strongest platforms for nano and micro-influencer sponsorships in 2026. Instagram's mature brand partnership ecosystem and range of content formats (Reels, carousels, Stories) make it the most popular choice. TikTok's high engagement rates and viral potential make it increasingly competitive, especially for product-focused content. Many small creators find success by being active on both and offering cross-platform packages.

### How do I know if a brand deal offer is legitimate?

Red flags include: brands asking you to pay upfront for anything, requests to purchase products with a promise of "reimbursement," vague contracts with no specific deliverables or payment terms, and offers that seem wildly above market rate for your size (if someone offers $5,000 for a single Story to an account with 2,000 followers, something is off). Legitimate brands will have a verifiable website, social media presence, and clear campaign brief. When in doubt, search the brand name plus "influencer scam" before agreeing to anything.

### How long does it take to start earning from brand deals?

It varies, but most creators who actively pitch and apply through platforms start landing their first paid deal within 4 to 8 weeks of focused effort. The timeline depends on your niche (some niches have more brand demand than others), your engagement rate, the quality of your media kit, and how consistently you're pitching. Creators who send 10 to 15 targeted pitches per week and apply to 5 to 10 platform campaigns tend to see results much faster than those who send one or two emails and wait.
