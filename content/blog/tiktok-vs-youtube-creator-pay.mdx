If you're a creator trying to figure out where to put your energy, the TikTok vs YouTube money question hits early. Both platforms are now dumping billions into creator programs, but the way that cash actually reaches your pocket couldn't be more different. YouTube rewards watch time on longer videos; TikTok bets on virality and short-form hooks. And in 2026, the gap between them has shifted yet again — TikTok's expanded Creativity Program is finally paying real money, while YouTube keeps printing AdSense checks like it always has.

This guide breaks down exactly how much each platform pays, where the money comes from, and which one makes more sense depending on the type of creator you are.

## How YouTube Pays Creators

YouTube's monetization model has been running for over a decade, and honestly, it's still the gold standard for ad-based creator income. Hit the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) thresholds — 1,000 subscribers and either 4,000 watch hours or 10 million Shorts views in the past 12 months — and you unlock AdSense revenue sharing.

### YouTube AdSense CPMs

Creators keep 55% of ad revenue on long-form content. How much that actually puts in your bank account depends heavily on your niche, where your audience lives, and the time of year (Q4 CPMs spike hard because of holiday ad spending — December checks hit different).

Here are typical YouTube [CPMs](/glossary#cpm) by niche in 2026:

| Niche | Estimated CPM (USD) |
|---|---|
| Personal finance / investing | $20 – $40 |
| Business & SaaS | $15 – $30 |
| Technology reviews | $10 – $20 |
| Health & fitness | $8 – $15 |
| Education | $7 – $14 |
| Gaming | $3 – $8 |
| Entertainment / vlogs | $3 – $7 |
| Music | $1.50 – $4 |

So a finance creator pulling 100,000 monthly views might earn $2,000 to $4,000 from ads alone. A gaming creator with the same views? Maybe $300 to $800. The variance is enormous, and it's the single biggest factor in YouTube earnings — your niche choice basically sets your income ceiling.

### YouTube Shorts Revenue

YouTube started sharing ad revenue on Shorts in early 2023. The model pools all Shorts ad revenue and distributes it based on each creator's share of total Shorts views. Creators get 45% of their allocated revenue (compared to 55% for long-form). In practice, Shorts CPMs land between $0.04 and $0.10 per thousand views — dramatically lower than long-form.

For a creator pulling in 10 million Shorts views per month, that works out to roughly $400 to $1,000. Decent pocket money, but let's be real — that's not a full-time income for most people.

## How TikTok Pays Creators

TikTok's monetization story has changed a lot since the early [Creator Fund](/glossary#creator-fund) days. The original Creator Fund was, to put it bluntly, terrible — payouts often landed at $0.02 to $0.04 per 1,000 views, and because the fund was a fixed pool, payouts per creator actually *decreased* as more people joined. Creators were rightfully angry about it.

### TikTok Creativity Program Beta

In late 2023, TikTok launched the Creativity Program Beta (now just called the Creativity Program), replacing the old fund for eligible creators. The key change: only videos longer than one minute qualify, and payouts are substantially higher.

Reported rates for the Creativity Program in 2026 range from $0.50 to $1.00 per 1,000 qualified views, with some creators in high-value niches reporting up to $1.50 CPM. That's a 10x to 25x improvement over the old Creator Fund — and it finally brings TikTok within striking distance of YouTube long-form CPMs, even if it's still below them.

Eligibility requirements for the Creativity Program:

- At least 10,000 followers
- At least 100,000 video views in the last 30 days
- Account in good standing
- Based in an eligible country (US, UK, France, Germany, and others)
- Must be 18 or older

### TikTok Pulse

TikTok Pulse places brand ads alongside the top 4% of trending content. If your video qualifies, you get a 50% revenue share. Sounds great on paper — but you can't opt in. TikTok's algorithm picks the qualifying content, which makes Pulse an inconsistent, bonus-when-it-happens kind of thing rather than something you can build a budget around.

## Head-to-Head Comparison: TikTok vs YouTube Pay

Here's the full breakdown of how each platform stacks up across every major monetization channel.

| Revenue Stream | YouTube | TikTok |
|---|---|---|
| **Ad revenue share (long-form)** | 55% of ad revenue; CPMs of $3 – $40 | Creativity Program: $0.50 – $1.50 per 1K views |
| **Short-form ad revenue** | 45% share; $0.04 – $0.10 per 1K views | Old Creator Fund: $0.02 – $0.04 per 1K views |
| **Minimum for monetization** | 1,000 subs + 4,000 watch hours | 10,000 followers + 100K views/month |
| **Sponsorship rates (100K followers)** | $1,000 – $5,000 per video | $500 – $3,000 per video |
| **Sponsorship rates (1M followers)** | $5,000 – $50,000 per video | $5,000 – $30,000 per video |
| **Live gifting** | Super Chat: creator keeps ~70% | TikTok Gifts: creator keeps ~50% |
| **Channel memberships** | Available at 1,000 subs | TikTok Subscriptions (limited rollout) |
| **E-commerce integration** | YouTube Shopping (product tags) | TikTok Shop (native storefront) |
| **Revenue predictability** | High — consistent monthly AdSense | Low to moderate — algorithm-dependent |

### What the Numbers Tell Us

YouTube wins decisively on **ad revenue per view** for long-form content — it's not even close. A YouTube video with 100,000 views in a mid-tier niche earns roughly $800 to $1,500 from ads. The same 100,000 qualified views on TikTok's Creativity Program? $50 to $150. That's a 5x to 15x gap.

For short-form, the gap narrows. YouTube Shorts still edges out TikTok's old Creator Fund rates, but here's the twist: TikTok's Creativity Program (for 1-minute-plus videos) now actually pays better than YouTube Shorts on a per-view basis.

The real nuance, though, is in **volume**. TikTok's algorithm can push a video to millions of views far more easily than YouTube's recommendation system. A TikTok creator might average 500,000 views per video while a YouTube creator in the same niche averages 50,000. That 10x volume difference can partially offset the CPM gap — partially.

## Sponsorships: Where TikTok Closes the Gap

For many mid-size creators (10K to 500K followers), sponsorships — not ad revenue — are the real money. And this is where the TikTok vs YouTube pay debate gets genuinely interesting.

TikTok creators often command strong sponsorship rates relative to their follower count, and it comes down to engagement. The average TikTok [engagement rate](/glossary#engagement-rate) hovers around 4% to 6%, while YouTube sits at 1.5% to 3.5%. Brands care about engagement because it correlates with purchase intent — and they're willing to pay for it.

<CalculatorLink href="/tiktok-sponsorship-rate-calculator">Calculate TikTok Sponsorship Rate</CalculatorLink>

A TikTok creator with 200,000 followers and a 5% engagement rate might charge $1,500 to $3,000 per sponsored post. Compare that to a YouTube creator with 200,000 subscribers who charges $2,000 to $6,000 per dedicated video — sounds like YouTube wins, right? But the production time on a YouTube video is usually 5x to 10x longer. When you factor in time investment per dollar earned, TikTok sponsorships are surprisingly competitive.

### Sponsorship Rate Factors

Several things affect what you can charge on either platform:

- **Niche**: Finance, tech, and B2B niches pay significantly more than lifestyle or entertainment
- **Engagement rate**: Higher engagement means more value per impression for brands
- **Content format**: Dedicated videos pay more than integrations or story mentions
- **Exclusivity**: Agreeing not to work with competitors bumps your rate up
- **[Usage rights](/glossary#usage-rights)**: If a brand wants to repurpose your content for their own ads, charge a premium — always

## Live Gifting and Direct Fan Support

Both platforms let fans throw money at you during live streams, but the economics play out differently.

YouTube's Super Chat and Super Stickers let viewers pay to highlight messages during lives. YouTube takes a 30% cut, leaving creators with roughly 70%. Super Thanks extends tipping to regular uploaded videos too. Top live streamers on YouTube can pull in $1,000 to $10,000 per stream from Super Chats alone.

TikTok Gifts work through a virtual currency system — viewers buy Coins, send Gifts during lives, which convert to Diamonds for creators. After TikTok takes its cut, creators typically keep around 50% of the original purchase value. That's a worse split than YouTube, but TikTok has a much more active gifting culture. Popular creators frequently earn $500 to $5,000 per live session.

Bottom line: YouTube gives you a bigger share of each dollar, but TikTok's audience is more conditioned to send gifts and there's less friction to participate.

## E-Commerce and Affiliate Revenue

This is where TikTok has been aggressive — and honestly, impressive. TikTok Shop, the platform's native e-commerce integration, lets creators sell products directly within the app. Creators earn commissions on affiliate sales (typically 5% to 20% depending on the product category) and can run their own storefronts.

TikTok Shop has quietly become a massive revenue stream for product-focused creators, especially in beauty, fashion, and home goods. Some creators now earn more from TikTok Shop commissions than from the Creativity Program itself. The whole "TikTok Made Me Buy It" phenomenon is real, and the algorithm actively promotes shoppable content — which means the platform is literally incentivized to make your product videos go viral.

YouTube Shopping lets creators tag products in videos and link to partner stores, but adoption has been slower. YouTube's audience tends to use the platform more for research and comparison rather than impulse purchases, which changes the conversion dynamic entirely.

## Which Platform Pays More for Different Creator Types

There's no single answer to the TikTok vs YouTube pay question. It depends entirely on what kind of creator you are.

### Go with YouTube if you're:

- **An educator or tutorial creator** — Long-form content in high-CPM niches (finance, tech, business) earns dramatically more on YouTube. A 15-minute tutorial can generate ad revenue for years after you publish it.
- **A niche expert** — YouTube's search-driven discovery gives your content a long shelf life. Videos from three years ago still pull views and revenue. Try getting that on TikTok.
- **Focused on predictable income** — AdSense payments are consistent and reliable. You can forecast monthly earnings with reasonable accuracy, which matters if you're paying rent with this.
- **Building a premium brand** — YouTube's longer format allows deeper storytelling and audience trust-building, which directly translates to higher sponsorship rates.

### Go with TikTok if you're:

- **A product-focused creator** — TikTok Shop integration makes it the clear winner for affiliate and e-commerce income, particularly in beauty, fashion, and consumer goods.
- **A new creator seeking fast growth** — TikTok's algorithm gives new accounts a genuine shot at viral reach. You can build a monetizable audience in months rather than years. That matters.
- **An entertainer or personality-driven creator** — Short, personality-driven content thrives on TikTok, and lower production overhead means more content and faster iteration.
- **Focused on live-streaming** — TikTok's gifting culture and live-stream discovery make it the stronger platform for real-time monetization.

### Best strategy: do both

The most successful creators in 2026 aren't loyal to one platform — they're platform-agnostic. They produce long-form content for YouTube (capturing high CPMs and evergreen search traffic), repurpose clips for TikTok and YouTube Shorts (capturing viral reach and new audience discovery), and run sponsorships across both. The platforms aren't mutually exclusive. They're complementary, and treating them that way is basically free money left on the table otherwise.

## The Bigger Picture: Platform Stability

One factor that gets overlooked in the TikTok vs YouTube pay debate is platform risk — and it's a big one. YouTube is owned by Google and has been paying creators consistently since 2007. Its monetization infrastructure is mature, reliable, and frankly boring in the best way. You know the check is coming.

TikTok, while enormously popular, has faced regulatory uncertainty in multiple countries. The ongoing discussions around data privacy and potential restrictions in the United States create real risk for creators who build their entire business on the platform. That doesn't mean you should avoid TikTok — the opportunity is absolutely real — but putting all your eggs in one basket here would be unwise. Diversify.

YouTube also offers better analytics, more granular audience data, and a more transparent revenue reporting system. If you're running your channel as a serious business (and you should be), those tools matter more than you think.

## FAQ

### How much does TikTok pay per 1,000 views in 2026?

Through the Creativity Program, you're looking at roughly $0.50 to $1.50 per 1,000 qualified views on videos longer than one minute. The old Creator Fund (for shorter videos) still pays the same disappointing $0.02 to $0.04 per 1,000 views. Your actual rate depends on where your audience is, how engaged they are, and what category your content falls into.

### How much does YouTube pay per 1,000 views?

It varies wildly by niche — that's the honest answer. Finance and business channels can see $15 to $40 per 1,000 monetized views, while gaming and entertainment channels typically earn $3 to $8. The platform-wide average sits around $5 to $12 CPM for long-form content. YouTube Shorts? Much less — around $0.04 to $0.10 per 1,000 views.

### Can you make a full-time income on TikTok alone?

You can, but it's tough if you're counting on the Creativity Program alone. Most full-time TikTok creators make the bulk of their money from sponsorships, TikTok Shop affiliate commissions, and selling their own products. Ad revenue from TikTok by itself typically requires millions of monthly views to replace a full-time salary — we're talking 3 to 5 million views a month minimum.

### Is YouTube Shorts better than TikTok for earning money?

On a pure per-view basis, Shorts pays slightly more than TikTok's old Creator Fund but less than TikTok's Creativity Program for longer videos. But here's the thing most people miss: the real value of YouTube Shorts is funneling viewers to your long-form content, where CPMs are 50x to 100x higher. Think of Shorts as a discovery tool, not a revenue source.

### Which platform is easier to get monetized on?

Neither is easy, let's be clear about that. YouTube requires 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours (or 10 million Shorts views). TikTok's Creativity Program needs 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in the last 30 days. For most new creators, YouTube's subscriber threshold is harder to reach initially. But TikTok's ongoing view requirement means you need to consistently produce content that performs — there's no coasting. TikTok follower growth tends to be faster thanks to algorithmic distribution, so most people get monetized there first.

### Do TikTok or YouTube sponsorships pay more?

Per deal, YouTube sponsorships typically pay more. Brands value the longer format and the evergreen nature of YouTube content — a sponsored YouTube video keeps generating impressions for months or years. But TikTok sponsorships take a fraction of the production time, so when you look at the effective hourly rate, they're surprisingly comparable. Creators with strong TikTok engagement rates can command competitive rates, especially in consumer product categories where that impulse-buy factor kicks in.
